## Abstract ##
The increasing demand for high-precision real-time data processing in satellite clusters requires efficient algorithms to manage inherent uncertainties in space-based systems. We propose an innovative framework that integrates Quantum Neural Network (QNN) architecture into Kalman filtering processes, specifically tailored for Low Earth Orbit satellite clusters. Our quantum computing-based approach achieves a significant improvement in prediction accuracy and a reduction in mean absolute error compared to classical Kalman filtering techniques. These advances significantly improve computational efficiency and error handling, making the method highly scalable under varying noise levels. A comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the Quantum Kalman Filter in processing speed, resource utilization, and prediction accuracy, all evaluated within the constraints of LEO satellite constellations. These findings highlight the potential of quantum computing to optimize data processing strategies for future missions, including deep space explorations.
